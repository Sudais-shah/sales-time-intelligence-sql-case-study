# sales-time-intelligence-sql-case-study (PostgreSQL + MySQL)
## Time-Based SQL Case Study 
This project showcases advanced usage of **time and date functions** in SQL, using a simulated sales database. It includes 30+ queries written in **PostgreSQL**, with **MySQL equivalents** provided in comments where applicable.

Each query is clearly documented to explain its logic, business use case, and the SQL functions used.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Practice all major time/date functions in SQL
- Demonstrate real-world business use cases
- Build a well-structured, documented SQL portfolio project
- Provide a dual reference: PostgreSQL + MySQL

---

## Key Concepts

- Current date/time: `CURRENT_DATE`, `NOW()`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, etc
- Date manipulation: `INTERVAL`, `AGE()`, etc
- Date extraction: `EXTRACT()`, etc
- Formatting: `TO_CHAR()`, `CAST()`, etc
- Aggregation by time: `DATE_TRUNC()`, `GROUP BY`
- Filtering: `BETWEEN`, date ranges, etc
- MySQL equivalents: `DATE_FORMAT()`, `DATEDIFF()`, `TIMESTAMPDIFF()`, etc.

##  How to Use

1. **Clone the repo:**
- git clone https://github.com/Sudais-shah/sales-time-intelligence-sql-case-study.git

---

## Learning Outcomes
 - Mastered time/date functions in PostgreSQL and MySQL
 - Built queries for real-world analytics (e.g., trends, comparisons)
 - Improved query documentation and code structure
 - Created a reusable SQL reference for future projects
